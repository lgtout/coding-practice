# coding-practice

This repo contains solutions for about 260 coding problems completed over the last year or so.  All are backed by tests that I wrote from scratch, too.
Most are in Kotlin for problems presented in the [Elements of Programming Interviews in Java](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/) book.
